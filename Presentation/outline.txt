Intro (Hi, I'm back)

    The intent of this presentation is a little bit of practical creativity.

Framing:
    This is meant for the beginner to intermediate Robot Framework user.
    Maybe someone who has written a few python based RF libraries.
    For more advanced users this could get you thinking in a different mindset.

Quick Demo - 'Get Length' Keyword

Use cases:
    Using RF libraries in python scripts as utilites.
    Leveraging RF within tools that are python only - locust.io

Story Time - locust.io and RF

Examine how to use:
- Standard libraries- BuiltIn, etc...
- 3rd Party- JSONLibrary (ng-jsonpath)
- Libraries that rely on instances- Requests

Dangerous Keywords
    Keywords that rely on RF to be 'running'
    Maybe not worth mocking RF to leverage those KW

Demo- Bigger Demo

Advantages:
- Speed?
- Python syntax?
- Fold back into RF Library
